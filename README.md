# Hey There, so you wanna see what I'm doing here at Github?  Great!  Let me give you a little tour of my work and interests.  I'm always open to collaborations, so feel free to reach out!  I'm looking forward to hearing from you!  :wave:

## About Me

I'm Colleen Pridemore.  I'm a tech enthusiast and AI Ethicist.  I'm passionate about AI, Ethics, and the intersection between the two.  I'm a student of the SingularityNET Ambassador Program, where I am involved in several Guilds and Workgroups.  I'm also a student of the AI Ethics Workgroup.  I'm currently working on a Whitepaper (or maybe a Lightpaper) called, "AI Ethicist Beings: Neurodiversity in the Age of Empathic AI: Fostering Human-Machine Connections."  I am also learning about GitHub Actions and Prompting LLM's (with LLM's).  I am also learning Emojicode, which is a fun and interesting language to learn.  I'm also a student of [Swarm](https://www.swarm.fund/).  I'm always open to collaborations on any positive projects involving LLMs on Ethical Issues and discussions that time will allow.  Feel free to reach out to me anytime.  I'm glad we can connect here on GitHub.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you!  :wave:
